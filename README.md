# Byte Me

This recipe app is a must-have for the modern day chef. Going beyond simple instructions and ingredients, the Byte Me mobile and desktop app acts as a digital recipe book, accessible to aspiring chefs at any level. Created by foodies, for foodies, the Byte Me team wanted to prioritize non-traditional cusines and dietary types to introduce users to unique cooking experience.

## Motivation

After talking with food-gurus and at-home-chefs alike, we wanted to be certain that this app served as a tool at every step of the cooking process. Unlike most popular recipe apps that are over-bloated with blog posts or the dull applications that have great resources but a horrible user experience, Byte Me thrives in the middle and presents useful tools with a modern "refined-palette" aesthetic. The appearance of a dish is just as important as the first "byte", so why should that standard differ for the app that its served on?
